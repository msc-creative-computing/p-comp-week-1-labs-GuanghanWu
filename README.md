In 2040, wearable devices developed very rapidly and have become very fashionable and practical devices. Residents almost have one. A very important application of this device is the search indication of objects or stores. This project is an example of the latest Bracelet internal indication signal system made this year. 
It is used to indicate the direction of a doorï¼Œand the example is divided into two parts. The first part is that the right direction can be displayed after the switch on the left is closed (the lights are on from left to right in turn), The second part, that is, after the switch on the right is closed, relies on the flashing frequency to tell the user the current distance from the final destination, and the flashing shape will also simulate the shape of the final navigation target object (this example is a door, so the lights on both sides flash, then flash in the middle, and then flash on both sides to express the meaning of being able to enter)
